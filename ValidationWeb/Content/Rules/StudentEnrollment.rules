When a student with an IEP is placed in residential care and treatment and parental rights have been terminated by court order, or the parent has left Minnesota after the student\'s placement, or the parent is an inmate of a Minnesota correctional facility the student should be flagged as Yes for Special Pupils for Care and Treatment.  For students without IEPs who are placed for residential care and treatment the only criteria to be eligible as a special pupil is that parental rights are terminated. No other criteria apply to students without IEPs. The student\'s SAC must be one of 14, 27, 28 or 46. Note that care and treatment does not include typical family foster homes. Additional reporting, independent of MARSS, is also required to generate the funding. Contact the Special Education Funding office for more information.'
